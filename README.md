Simple Barchart using React, D3 and GraphQL Request.

The project fetches posts from a mock GraphQL API and displays a barchart representing the number of posts created in each month of 2019.

Started the project by fetching the data when the component is mounted.
Filtered the data in posts component to get only the posts from 2019 and made an array of objects to store the number of posts for each month.
Passed the data as props to the chart component.

The hardest part was creating a D3 chart, because this was my first time using this library.
